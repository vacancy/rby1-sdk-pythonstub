# RBY1 SDK Python Stub

This is a Python SDK stub for interacting with the RBY1 robot. It is generated from the original SDK at [RainbowRobotics/rby1-sdk](https://github.com/RainbowRobotics/rby1-sdk). This can be directly imported in Python to get completions (without the need of compiling the actual SDK).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vacancy/rby1-sdk-pythonstub.git
   cd rby1-sdk-pythonstub
   ```

2.	Install the package using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can import and use the SDK stub in your Python projects:

```python
import rby1_sdk
rby1_sdk.  # Tab to get completions
```
